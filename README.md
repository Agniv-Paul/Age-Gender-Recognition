# Age and Gender Recognition Project

## Introduction

This repository is dedicated to a project focusing on Age and Gender Recognition through the use of computer vision and deep learning techniques. The primary objective is to develop a system capable of accurately predicting the age and gender of individuals based on images or video streams.

## Features

- **Age Prediction:** Accurate estimation of age from facial images.
- **Gender Prediction:** Identification of gender from facial images.
- **Easy Integration:** Designed for seamless integration with image and video processing pipelines.
- **Pre-trained Models:** Quick deployment using pre-trained models.
- **Customizable Architecture:** Flexibility for customization and extension.

## Model Architecture 
The model architecture is based on a deep neural network designed for facial feature extraction and age/gender prediction.

## Installation
